## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install BaseX on Windows

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Download BaseX

1. Go to [https://basex.org/download](https://basex.org/download)
2. Download the **ZIP** file or the **EXE installer** for Windows  
   *(I recommend the EXE if you want the quickest way)*

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Install or run it

- If you downloaded the `.EXE`, install it as usual and open **BaseX GUI** from the start menu.
- If you downloaded the `.ZIP`, extract it and run `basexgui.bat`.
