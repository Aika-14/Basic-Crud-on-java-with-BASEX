# 🧩 How to Install BaseX (And Why You Might Already Want to Uninstall It)

First of all, **BaseX can be a bit of a pain**, so if you're struggling, you're not alone. But I've been there before, so here's a simple guide to help you get it up and running.

## 1️⃣ Install BaseX on Windows

### ✅ Step 1: Download BaseX

1. Go to [https://basex.org/download](https://basex.org/download)  
2. Download the **ZIP file** or the **EXE installer** for Windows  
   *(I recommend the EXE for the fastest setup)*

### ✅ Step 2: Configure the Port (If Needed)

If you’re running the BaseX server and it fails to start, it might be due to a port conflict.  
You can change the port it uses by editing the `BaseXServer.bat` file or using the GUI settings, depending on how you’re launching it.

### 🔐 Default Credentials

If you're prompted for a username and password and have no idea what they are:  
- **Default username:** `admin`  
- **Default password:** `admin`  
(Yes, very secure...)

### 💀 Good Luck (You're Gonna Need It)

Just kidding. Sort of.  
BaseX can be tricky to get working smoothly the first time, but once it's set up, it’s actually pretty powerful for working with XML and XQuery.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you run into problems:  
- Make sure Java is installed and updated  
- Try running BaseX as administrator  
- Check firewall settings if the server doesn’t start  
- If you’re stuck, feel free to reach out or look through [BaseX’s documentation](https://docs.basex.org) or put an issue in the github because the documentation is horrible
